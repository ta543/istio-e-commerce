# 🌐 Advanced Istio E-Commerce Platform 🛒

## 📋 Overview

This project demonstrates an advanced usage of Istio within a Kubernetes environment to manage a microservices-based e-commerce platform. It showcases features like traffic management, security enhancements, observability, and resilience patterns. The platform consists of several key microservices: `Product Catalog Service`, `User Accounts Service`, `Shopping Cart Service`, and `Order Processing Service`.

## 🚀 Prerequisites

- Kubernetes Cluster (Minikube, EKS, GKE, AKS, or any Kubernetes-compatible environment)
- Istio Service Mesh installed on the cluster
- Docker
- kubectl command-line tool configured to interact with your cluster

## ✨ Features

- **Traffic Management**: Utilizes Istio's powerful traffic management capabilities, including gateways, virtual services, and destination rules for efficient traffic routing and versioned deployments.

- **Security**: Implements strict mTLS policies for secure service-to-service communication and fine-grained access control with authorization policies.

- **Observability**: Integrates with Prometheus for metrics collection, Grafana for metrics visualization, and Jaeger for distributed tracing.

- **Resilience**: Demonstrates patterns like circuit breaking, rate limiting, and fault injection to improve the system's robustness.
